[BioTuring Single Cell Browser](https://bioturing.com/product/bbrowser) combines modern data visualization techniques, statistical machine learning toolboxes, and a rich knowledge base to create a unique platform for single cell data analytics.

[BioTuring Single-cell Browser] (or [BBrowser]) provides interactive access to a comprehensive and growing single-cell RNA-seq and CITE-seq database. Here scientists can instantly view the t-SNE or UMAP of the data, plot and compare the expression of multiple genes/proteins across cell groups, find markers and differentially expressed genes of any populations, run enrichment analysis, study how cell composition changes across conditions, study subtypes, reconstruct cell trajectories and study genes transitionining along a biological process, etc.

This single-cell database is also supported with a wide range of cross-study analyses and data integration to facilitate target validation across millions of cells.

In addition to providing a portal for public single-cell data, BBrowser is also adaptable with Seurat and Scanpy objects, raw FASTQ files and count matrices from single-cell RNA-seq, CITE-seq and spatial transcriptomics technologies. Scientists can easily import and analyze their own data, and leverage BBrowser's single-cell omics database for cell type identification.
